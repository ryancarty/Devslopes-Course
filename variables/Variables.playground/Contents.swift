//Operators

//Unay, Binary, Ternary
    //Binary- operates on two targets (left and right)
        var amICool = true
    //Unary- works on a single operator/one target
        //Unary prefix operator
        amICool = !amICool
    //Ternary- The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result upon a true comparison, and the third is the result upon a false comparison. If it helps you can think of the operator as shortened way of writing an if-else statement.
